1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would 
have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

I cached the average score for each subreddit, before the .join() function. If I had not used the cache, the program would have 
taken a bit longer to run, the time would have been spent reading the df for information.


2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

According to the results above, the run time differed between using broadcast() and not using broadcast(), the DataFrame for broadcasting can improve the run time.
