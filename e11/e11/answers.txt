1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would 
have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

I cached the average score for each subreddit, before the .join() function. If I had not used the cache, the program would have 
taken a bit longer to run, the time would have been spent reading the df for information again.


2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

with broadcast: 

real    0m11.364s
user    0m10.000s
sys     0m2.844s

without broadcast:

real    0m27.731s
user    3m8.266s
sys     0m14.219s


According to the results above, the run time differed between using broadcast() and not using broadcast().
Broadcasting improves/shortens the runtime of the best authors program.
