1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

The square root transformation got the closest.

2. We gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. 
Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would 
be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

The original T-test determines if there is a significant difference between the means of 2 groups, and the transformed data T-test tests
how significant the difference between the means of the square rooted data is. If we could reject the null hypothesis (p<0.05) then
we could conclude that there is a low chance the means of the 2 groups are the same.

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question:
 “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. 
 (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

I think the weekly data test does a better job of getting an answer because it groups it such that the data is distributed normally, 
shown by a p value > 0.05 and then takes a mean. In the other cases, there are smaller p-values that could mean the data is not normal
and therefore gives less accurate readings when taking the mean.

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

More comments are posted on average on weekdays.
