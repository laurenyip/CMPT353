1. Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? 
    Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?

I don't think the residual is close enough to being normal because there's a long left tail (left skewed) and the graph is not symmetrical/balanced.
So I would not look at the OLS p-value, and would not conclude reasonably that the ratings are increasing.


2. Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

Yes, I think that it is better. Based on the image generated, the Kalman filter seems to be doing a better job at finding the signal/closer grouping.
